# Banned-pattern allowlist: bootstrapping stubs with expiry and tracking.
# Each entry allows specific phrases in a file until remove_by.
# Format: file, allowed_phrases, reason, remove_by, owner_role, notes.
# Add entries when Guard fails but the finding is an intentional dev stub.

# Example (uncomment and edit when you add real allowlist entries):
# - file: Core/HAL/hal_13700k.cpp
#   allowed_phrases:
#     - "Simulated value"
#     - "simulated for development"
#     - "Placeholder"
#   reason: HAL development stubs until real MSR/hardware read
#   remove_by: "2026-06-01"
#   owner_role: implementer
#   notes: Replace with actual CPUID/MSR or document as unsupported

# - file: Core/Evolution/evolution_engine.cpp
#   allowed_phrases:
#     - "Stub implementations"
#     - "For now, run synchronously"
#   reason: GA stubs until full algorithm set implemented
#   remove_by: "post-bootstrap"
#   owner_role: implementer
#   notes:

# Leave list empty (no entries) to require zero banned patterns for Guard PASS.
