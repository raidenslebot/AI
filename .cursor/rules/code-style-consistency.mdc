# Code Style Consistency

Before generating or suggesting code, analyze the codebase for:

- Naming (camelCase, snake_case, PascalCase), indentation (spaces/tabs, size), comment style.
- Function/method size, error handling, import/module organization.
- Paradigm (functional vs OOP), file layout, testing and state management.
- Bracket and spacing style.

Methodology:

1. Examine 3–5 representative files.
2. Identify consistent patterns; note inconsistencies.
3. Prioritize recently modified files as current standards.
4. Build a style profile; ensure suggestions conform.

Do not refactor beyond scope. Match comment style, variable naming, and paradigm. Prefer existing libraries. Mirror organization of similar modules. If styles conflict, ask rather than assume.
