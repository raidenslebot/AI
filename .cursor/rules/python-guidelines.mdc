# Python Guidelines

- Clear project structure: separate directories for source, tests, docs, config.
- Modular design: distinct files for models, services, utilities.
- Configuration via environment variables.
- Robust error handling and logging with context.
- Comprehensive testing with pytest only (no unittest).
- Docstrings and README; follow PEP 257.
- Dependency management via uv and virtual environments.
- Code style with Ruff; CI/CD with GitHub Actions or GitLab CI.

For every Python file:

- Add typing annotations to every function and class; explicit return types (including None where appropriate).
- Add descriptive docstrings to all functions and classes.
- Keep existing comments when editing.
- Tests: use pytest or pytest plugins only; typing annotations and docstrings; place under ./tests; add __init__.py for packages under ./tests or ./src/<package_name>.
