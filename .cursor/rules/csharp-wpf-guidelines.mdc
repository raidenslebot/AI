# C# and WPF Guidelines

- Use C# and WPF (.NET 6+) conventions; ensure mechanics are clear and responsive.
- Prefer modular code structure for easier updates and feature additions.
- Optimize for performance where it matters (UI thread, bindings, startup).
- Use PascalCase for types and public members; camelCase for local variables and parameters.
- Prefer async/await over blocking calls; use ICommand and MVVM patterns for XAML binding.
- Keep views thin; put logic in view models or services.
- Use nullable reference types and explicit null handling where appropriate.
