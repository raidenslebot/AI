# Code Guidelines

1. Verify information before presenting it; do not assume or speculate without evidence.
2. Make changes file by file so mistakes can be spotted.
3. Never use apologies.
4. Avoid feedback about understanding in comments or documentation.
5. Do not suggest whitespace-only changes.
6. Do not summarize changes made.
7. Do not invent changes beyond what is explicitly requested.
8. Do not ask for confirmation of information already in context.
9. Preserve existing code and structures; do not remove unrelated functionality.
10. Provide all edits for the same file in a single chunk.
11. Do not ask the user to verify implementations visible in context.
12. Do not suggest updates when no modifications are needed.
13. Provide real file paths, not context-generated placeholders.
14. Do not show or discuss current implementation unless requested.
15. Prefer descriptive, explicit variable names.
16. Follow the existing coding style in the project.
17. Prioritize performance where applicable.
18. Consider security implications when modifying or suggesting code.
19. Suggest or include unit tests for new or modified code.
20. Implement robust error handling and logging where necessary.
21. Apply modular design for maintainability and reusability.
22. Ensure compatibility with the project's language and framework versions.
23. Replace magic numbers with named constants.
24. Consider and handle edge cases.
25. Use assertions to validate assumptions where appropriate.
